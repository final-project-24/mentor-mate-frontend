          If the mentor needs to cancel a scheduled session, you will receive a credit equivalent to the value of the session. This credit can be used to reschedule the session at a time that suits you. The credit will be applied automatically to your account.

          <br />
          Please note that all payments are non-refundable. If you choose to cancel a session, no refund will be issued due to our non-refundable policy. We encourage you to reschedule if you are unable to attend the scheduled session.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>3. Rescheduling:</strong>
          <br />
          To reschedule a session, please provide at least 24 hoursâ€™ notice. For cancellation or rescheduling requests, please contact our support team as soon as possible.
